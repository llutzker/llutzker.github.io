I currently work as a Research Data Analyst at the UC Berkeley Safe 
Transportation Researcher and Education Center (SafeTREC) and am also a 
doctoral student in Epidemiology at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health. 
At SafeTREC, I focus most of my  work on Vision Zero and the Safe System 
Approach, especially Safe Speeds.

I also co-founded and co-lead Walk Bike Berkeley, an all-volunteer, non-profit 
pedestrian and bicycle advocacy organization in Berkeley CA, and I also sit on 
a variety of commissions for the city of Berkeley, including the Transportation 
Commission and the Reimagining Public Safety Task Force. 

The focus of my research is to uncover the policies, practices, and 
institutions that create injustices in the transportation system while harming 
or failing to improve transportation safety. Some of my projects include 
examining the traffic safety impacts of traditional police traffic enforcement and 
restrictions on drivers' licenses based on immigration or poverty.
